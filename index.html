        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Our project is a suite of four arcade games which are played on the OLED screen. Two of the games use the TV remote as an input device, and the other two use the onboard accelerometer. At the end of each game we ask the user for their initials and then email their initials, score, and what game they were playing via AWS.</p>

        <p>Users will first be able to pick a game from the selection screen. Once a game has been selected, it will load onto the screen. Users will be able to play the game to try and aim for a high score. Once they get a game over, the game will end and they will type in their initials. Their score and initials will be sent via email and the user will be led to the game selection screen again.</p>

        <p>Users will be able to pick which game they want to play using the TV remote input at the selection screen on the OLED. If they choose an accelerometer game, the accelerometer will be used as their controller input, if they choose a TV remote game, the TV remote will be used as their controller input. Once their game ends, they will type their initials using the TV remote. AWS will email their initials and score.</p>

        <h2>Implementation:</h2>
        <p>To connect to the OLED, we used the write command and data and Adafruit initialization functions. The UI, selection screens, game, and game-over screens are shown and updated based on inputs on the OLED. Users can use the arrow buttons, OK button, and menu button to navigate through the UI.</p>

        <p>To obtain the values from the CC3200 accelerometer, we used I2C read and write. Based on these values, they controlled the accelerometer games “Dodgeball” and “Baskets”. For “Dodgeball”, the accelerometer was used to control the position of the player in order to dodge objects coming from the edges of the screen. If the x and y values of the player and objects are equal to each other, the game is over. For “Baskets”, the accelerometer was used to control the x-position of the player in order to collect points and dodge objects coming from the top of the screen. If the x and y values of the player and points are equal to each other, the score is increased. For the player and objects, the game is over. For both games, we used a for loop and an array to create many objects and to store their properties such as speed.</p>
        <p>In order to decode the bit patterns of the arrow buttons, OK button, and menu button we reused a program we wrote for lab three where you can press a button on the remote and it will print out to the terminal what bit pattern the microcontroller received. This made decoding these buttons really simple and easy. We then used these buttons and our previous experience of drawing things on the OLED to build our games. For Snake when the user presses one of the arrow buttons it changes the direction of the snake’s velocity which then makes the snake go a different direction on the screen (as long as that direction is orthogonal to the current direction, i.e. it can’t go left if it is already going right). In order to make the game run smoother we figured out that you only need to redraw the head of the snake and erase the last block of the tail to make it look like it is moving forward while redrawing the least amount of things possible. Collision detection was a big part of all of our games and in Snake we needed to not only detect collision with the walls but also with the apples the snake is eating and with the snake’s body itself. To do this we used the coordinates of the head of the snake and checked whether those coordinates overlapped with the coordinates of the boundary of the screen, the apple, or the snake’s body which was stored in an array that we iterated through. For Breakout in order to draw all the blocks and keep track of their positions we created a struct that had both the x and y coordinates and then put each block in an array. When we checked collision between the ball and the blocks we iterated through the array checking the x and y coordinates to see if they overlapped, if they did we then erased the block, set it’s x and y coordinates to -100 so it will never overlap with the ball again, and reversed the balls x or y direction based on if it hit the side or top/bottom of the block. For the paddle that the player controls with the arrow buttons we checked collision the same way and just reversed the ball’s y direction if it hit the paddle. If the ball hit the top of the screen we also reversed it’s y direction, and if it hit the walls we reversed it’s x direction.</p>
        <p>For selecting which game to play the player uses the up and down buttons on the menu screen to hover over the games and then uses the ok button to select the game they are hovering over to play. Each of our games is implemented in its own function so when the ok button is pressed then that game’s function is called and the player can press the menu button at any time to end the game and return to the menu screen.</p> 
        <p>At the end of each game we print out the player’s score, which is calculated differently depending on the game (for Dodgeball it is based on time survived, Baskets is amount of points collected, Snake is 20 points per apple eaten, and Breakout is 20 points per block broken), and then ask for the player’s initials which they can input using the number keys on the TV remote via multi-tap typing like in lab three. We then take their score, initials, and game played and use AWS to send an email that is in the format “Congratulations [initials] on getting [score] in [game]” using the sprintf function to format the string. To send the email we use the same code we wrote in lab four.</p>

        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <p>A challenge we faced was getting the game to run smoothly. Drawing objects on the OLED takes time, and with many objects on the screen, this causes the game to run slowly. To combat this, we used smaller objects and only redrew objects that needed to be redrawn. For the snake game, only the front and back of the snake was redrawn. For the accelerometer games, the objects were made smaller in order for the game to run smoothly.</p>
        <p>Another challenge we faced was collision detection in all of the games because the way that rectangles are drawn on the OLED isn’t immediately intuitive. They are drawn from the upper left corner which means that is where their x and y coordinates are so when you are doing collision detection you need to take into account the height and width of the rectangle. We solved this by basically checking to see if the object is within the range of [x, x + width] and [y, y + height]. We also had to do a similar thing for circles since their x and y coordinates are in the center of the circle so we have to take into account the radius of the circle when checking collision.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Future Work:</h2>
        <p>In the future, we would like to make the games run smoother. Updating each object on screen takes some time which limits the amount of objects and the size of objects in order to make everything run smoothly. We would like to add a website that keeps track of initials and highscores so users can view their and others scores. We would also like to add even more games so our project can feel like an actual arcade with many options to select.</p>
